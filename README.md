# selfWork

## Synopsis

I'm not sure where this project will lead me.  I am currently just using this for random code challenges I decide to do or other work I think I need to practice on.

## Motivation

I have not felt very confident in my javascript abilities so I am taking time between bootcamp modules to work on some of what I consider my weaknesses.
